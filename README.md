# C Extensions for Python

A few examples of how the Python-C API can be used to create extensions for
Python. 

In these examples, I take a C function for performing an independent samples
t-test and make it available in Python.

`v1` makes use of the Python-C API only.

`v2` makes additional use of the Numpy-C API.
